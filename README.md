## Message from the author

This app is something I've always wanted to make ever since I came across the HF ecosystem 2 years ago, especially the different NLP capabilities that it offers (now there are more, but i wanted to start with this). I hope to introduce more features into this as I learn more in the future. So yeah, I am super proud of how this turned out. Although I'm sure there might be more similar apps such as this. But its been on my mind for a long time and I'm glad its been built now. There's ofcourse room for improvement, I look forward to change and experiment things as I move forward with this.
