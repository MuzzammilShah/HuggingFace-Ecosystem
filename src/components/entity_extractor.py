        **Model**: `dslim/bert-base-NER`
        
        This is a fine-tuned BERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset.
        
        - **Entities**: Recognizes PER (Person), ORG (Organization), LOC (Location), and MISC (Miscellaneous)
        - **Performance**: F1 Score of ~91% on CoNLL-2003 test set
        - **Base Model**: BERT Base
        
        The model uses BIO tagging scheme (Beginning, Inside, Outside) to mark entity spans and supports aggregation for better entity grouping.
