        ### Example 1: Solar System
        
        **Context:**
        ```
        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
        The largest of these objects are the eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
        Jupiter is the largest planet, with a mass more than twice that of all the other planets combined. 
        Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide on its surface. 
        Pluto was considered the ninth planet until 2006, when it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.
        ```
        
        **Questions to try:**
        - Which is the largest planet in the Solar System?
        - Why is Mars called the Red Planet?
        - How many planets are in the Solar System?
        - What happened to Pluto in 2006?
        
        ### Example 2: World War II
        
        **Context:**
        ```
        World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. 
        The Axis powers were led by Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Fascist Italy. The Allied Powers were led by Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.
        The war began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. 
        The United States entered the war in December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. 
        The war in Europe ended with Germany's surrender on May 8, 1945, while Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
        ```
        
        **Questions to try:**
        - When did World War II begin?
        - Which countries led the Axis powers?
        - Why did the United States enter the war?
        - When did Germany surrender?

        **Model**: `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`
        
        This is a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v2.
        
        - **Task**: Extractive question answering (finding the span of text that answers a question)
        - **Performance**: F1 score of ~80% on SQuAD v2
        - **Base Model**: RoBERTa Base (125M parameters)
        
        The model works by finding the most likely span of text in the context that answers the question. It's particularly effective for factual questions where the answer is explicitly stated in the context.
